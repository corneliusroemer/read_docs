General Guide On ENA Data Submission
====================================

Welcome to the general guide for the European Nucleotide Archive submission.
Please take a moment to view this introduction and consider the options
available to you before you begin your submission.

ENA allows submissions via three routes, each of which is appropriate for a
different set of submission types. You may be required to use more than one in
the process of submitting your data:

- **Interactive Submissions** are completed by filling out web forms directly
  in your browser and downloading template spreadsheets that can be completed
  off-line and uploaded to ENA. This is often the most accessible submission route.
- **Command Line Submissions** use our bespoke Webin-CLI program. This
  validates your submissions entirely before you complete them, allowing you
  maximum control of the process.
- **Programmatic Submissions** are completed by preparing your submissions as
  XML documents and either sending them to ENA using a program such as cURL or using
  the `Webin Portal <general-guide/submissions-portal.html>`_.

The table below outlines what can be submitted through each submission route.
It is also recommended that you familiarise yourself with our `metadata model
<general-guide/metadata.html>`_.
